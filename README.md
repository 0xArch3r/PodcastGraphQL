# PodcastGraphQL

## Summary
Small Project that places a GraphQL wrapper around the Apple Itunes Search REST API and RSS Feeds. 
This project is written in Golang and utilizes the Graphqlgen libraries to handle most of the GraphQL functionality.
There will be an additional repo that is going to be a mobile application written in React Native that will
interact with this API.
